As part of the *Cybersecurity Course for Companies*, organized by the [CiberUGR Chair](https://citic.ugr.es/), I was invited to deliver a talk titled **“Innovation and Security in Smart Urban Infrastructures.”**

In this session, I shared insights from my work at **Innovasur**, where we design and operate secure AI-based systems for smart city platforms. My goal was to break down the intersection of **cutting-edge urban innovation** and **cybersecurity**, highlighting how both must evolve together.

### 🔐 Core topics I covered

- Why security is a *foundational element* in smart infrastructure—not just an add-on.
- How we design platforms with **end-to-end protection**, including IoT networks, AI-powered surveillance, and data aggregation systems.
- Real examples of threat mitigation and incident response in urban environments.
- Importance of complying with standards like **ENS** (Spanish National Security Scheme) and **GDPR** from the design phase.
- The growing role of **AI in threat detection**, and how we use ML models to monitor anomalies in real-time.

### 🧩 Lessons and reflections

Cities are becoming more connected, but also more exposed. Our responsibility as solution providers is to make sure that *resilience and security grow hand-in-hand with technological innovation*. That means:

- Building **redundant, decentralized architectures**.
- Training public administration teams to respond to digital incidents.
- Embedding security awareness at every level of the deployment.


This session gave me the opportunity to discuss how we’re securing the future of our cities—both through technology and policy-driven collaboration.
