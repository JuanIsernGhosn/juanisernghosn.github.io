On **April 25th, 2024**, I participated in the roundtable **"AI Perspectives and Challenges"** at the **4th Somos Digital Meeting** in Torremolinos. The panel brought together professionals from technology, education, and digital transformation to discuss the ethical, regulatory, and societal implications of artificial intelligence.

I joined as **AI Manager at Innovasur**, contributing with my experience leading smart city AI deployments and discussing how we integrate ethics, cybersecurity, and legal frameworks into our technology design process from day one.

### 🎙️ My take on key discussion topics

**📚 Education**  
I emphasized how AI is reshaping how we learn and teach. It’s critical to train both students and educators not just in technical skills, but in **AI literacy**—understanding model limitations, ethics, and implications for society.

**💼 Employment**  
We discussed the evolving job market. My view: AI won't eliminate work, but it **reshapes the nature of jobs**. The most resilient professionals will be those able to combine **domain expertise** with **data and automation fluency**.

**🛡️ Regulation & digital rights**  
As someone who works closely with public institutions, I advocated for **proactive regulation** that ensures transparency without stifling innovation. We also explored mechanisms to protect rights in high-risk use cases like biometrics or decision-making systems.

**🎭 Deepfakes and disinformation**  
In a world of manipulated content, we need **multi-layered AI validation strategies**. From model watermarking to cross-source verification, I believe platforms and public institutions must co-develop countermeasures to combat disinformation.

**🔮 Looking ahead**  
When asked about the future, I shared that in 10 years, AI will be everywhere—but invisible. Our challenge today is not just to create intelligent systems, but **trustworthy ones** that serve the common good.
