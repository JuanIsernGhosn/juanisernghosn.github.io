On **October 4th, 2024**, I had the pleasure of delivering the **inaugural talk** for the 2024–2025 academic year of the **Master's Degree in Data Science and Computer Engineering** at the **University of Granada’s School of Computer and Telecommunications Engineering (ETSIIT)**.

The session was titled: **“The transformative role of Data Science and its impact on Smart Cities”**.

### 🧠 Data science as a driver for urban innovation

Throughout the talk, I shared our experience at Innovasur in applying **data-driven approaches** to address urban challenges. We discussed how **AI, IoT, real-time data pipelines, and cybersecurity** are shaping the future of urban environments—making them more **efficient, reactive, and citizen-focused**.

We covered several key topics, such as:

- How data science is becoming a core pillar of **urban strategy and policy**.
- Real examples of **smart city platforms** that integrate sensor data, camera feeds, and incident management.
- The value of combining **machine learning and computer vision** to automate event detection and optimize services.
- The role of **secure architectures** for handling large-scale IoT deployments in urban settings.

### 🎓 Talking to the next generation

The most exciting part was speaking directly to students starting their journey into data science. I encouraged them to embrace the complexity of real-world problems and to see beyond the algorithms—to think in terms of **solutions, value, and social impact**.

I also shared insights into:

- **What companies are looking for** in future data scientists.
- Why understanding both the **technical and strategic aspects** of data is key.
- How to align academic projects with **real-world needs** in smart cities, especially in areas like:
  - Real-time incident detection.
  - Visualization dashboards for decision-making.
  - Scalable and secure data infrastructures.
