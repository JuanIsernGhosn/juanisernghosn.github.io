On **October 27th, 2023**, I had the pleasure of speaking at the **PivoAndCode** series hosted by **XauenDevs** in Jaén, a community of developers passionate about sharing knowledge and growing together. The event took place at **CuatroGatos Coworking**, a vibrant local hub of innovation.

My talk, titled **"From zero to hero with MLOps"**, was a hands-on walkthrough of modern practices for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in real-world production environments.

### 🧪 What we explored

During this session, I shared a full tour through the **MLOps lifecycle**, highlighting critical aspects like:

- Data versioning and preprocessing strategies
- Pipeline orchestration with reproducibility in mind
- CI/CD practices adapted to machine learning workflows
- Deployment strategies for real-time and batch inference
- Model monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining
- Tooling recommendations: DVC, MLflow, FastAPI, Docker, Prometheus

We grounded the talk in real examples from our experience at **Innovasur**, where we apply these practices in smart city projects that require resilient, explainable, and scalable AI systems.

### 💬 Reflections from the session

MLOps is not just about deploying models—it's about **ensuring they live sustainably**. One of the most engaging parts of the event was the lively Q&A, where we debated:

- When does it make sense to automate training pipelines?
- What’s the tradeoff between simplicity and scalability?
- How do you onboard teams into MLOps without overwhelming them?

As always, I was inspired by the energy of local developers in Jaén. It was a fantastic space for exchanging ideas and forging connections.
