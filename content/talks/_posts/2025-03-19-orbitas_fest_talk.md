As part of the **Órbitas Festival**, organized by the [Escuela de Arte y Superior de Diseño José Nogué](https://escueladeartejosenogue.es/), I was invited to take part in the round table titled **“The Age of AI: Impact, Ethics, and Creative Potential.”**

This discussion brought together voices from the fields of education, design, and artificial intelligence to explore the opportunities and ethical challenges posed by AI. The format was intentionally casual and open, encouraging the exchange of different perspectives and honest reflections.

### 💬 Core topics we discussed

- How **AI is transforming creativity**, from image generation to music composition.
- **The ethical tensions** behind using generative AI tools in education and the workplace.
- My experience leading **AI initiatives at Innovasur**, where transparency and responsibility are key pillars.
- The need for **digital literacy and critical thinking** when interacting with AI-driven systems.
- How regulation can support—not hinder—creative innovation in AI.

### 🧠 My perspective

During the round table, I emphasized that *ethics should not be an afterthought in AI*. Whether we’re talking about smart cities or educational tools, we need frameworks that combine **technical robustness** with **human values**. That means:

- Designing explainable systems that foster trust.
- Being clear about the boundaries between automation and human creativity.
- Promoting ethical guidelines early in the development process.

AI doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It shapes—and is shaped by—the people who design, deploy, and use it. I believe our collective role as technologists, educators and creatives is to ensure that AI serves as a **force for empowerment**, not manipulation.
