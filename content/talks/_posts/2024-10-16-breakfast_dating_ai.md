On October 16th, 2024, I had the opportunity to deliver a keynote at the event **“Breakfast Dating Innovation: Urban Automation with Artificial Intelligence,”** held at the *Centro de Formación Reina Isabel* in Granada. ACELERAPYME, the Andalusian Agency for Innovation and Development, organized this event in collaboration with the **Escuela de Negocios de Andalucía** and **Innovasur**.

This session was part of a multi-format event designed to showcase how AI and digital innovation are transforming cities. I focused on our work at **Innovasur** and how we’re leveraging AI to automate and optimize critical urban operations.

### 🚀 Reflections from the session

Cities today face enormous complexity. By automating routine and data-heavy processes with AI, we free up time and resources to focus on what matters most: resilience, sustainability, and citizen well-being.

One of the key messages I emphasized was the **need for ethical deployment and trust** in AI systems. It’s not just about building smart platforms—it's about building platforms that respect privacy, are secure by design, and are explainable to the public.
