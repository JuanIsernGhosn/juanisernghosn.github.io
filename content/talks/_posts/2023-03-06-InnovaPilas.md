On **March 6th, 2023**, I delivered a talk titled **"Artificial Intelligence Applied to City Management"** at the **INNOVA'23 conference** in Pilas, Seville.

This session was part of a broader initiative to bring digital innovation closer to local governments and small municipalities. I was invited as the **AI Manager at Innovasur**, where I lead projects that apply computer vision and data science to solve real-world problems in urban environments.

### üí° Topics I covered

- **How to create urban applications** using real-time video analytics and **edge computing** with **NVIDIA-based solutions**.
- **Crowd monitoring and occupancy tracking** using AI models deployed on edge devices.
- **Traffic flow optimization and incident detection** through automatic video analysis.
- Integration of these AI modules into **IN4CITY**, our modular smart city platform based on FIWARE.
- Practical examples from active deployments in Spanish municipalities, including lessons learned and scalability strategies.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key takeaways

This wasn‚Äôt just a technical demo‚Äîit was an **invitation to rethink urban services through AI**. I emphasized how local governments can start small with practical use cases and build scalable, interoperable systems by:

- Using pre-trained AI models and adapting them to local data.
- Deploying on affordable hardware with **edge inference** capabilities.
- Connecting vision-based data flows with dashboards and event-driven alerts in IN4CITY.
- Ensuring data privacy and ethical use from day one.
