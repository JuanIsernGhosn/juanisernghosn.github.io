On **October 25, 2023**, I had the honor of participating in the round table organized by the **Corporaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica de Andaluc√≠a (CTA)**, under the title _‚ÄúInteligencia artificial responsable y legal. Impacto de la ley europea sobre IA en la empresa‚Äù_. This technical conference brought together professionals and thought leaders from the AI and business landscape, including representatives from **Cibernos**, **Fundaci√≥n Progreso y Salud**, **GMV**, **Vodafone**, and **Innovasur**.

### Framing the topic

The session focused on the **transformative impact of the EU AI Act** and how it is shaping the landscape of artificial intelligence in Europe. I shared our perspective from **Innovasur**, where we approach AI development through a dual strategic lens: **cybersecurity** and **smart cities**.

My intervention revolved around the **core pillars of responsibility and transparency**, emphasizing that:

- The **power of AI**, especially in sensitive sectors like **healthcare** or **energy**, requires **an inherent sense of responsibility**.
- At Innovasur, we prioritize **ethics and trust** in every step of our work, acknowledging the sensitive nature of the information we handle.

### Key takeaways from my intervention

üåç **The impact of the EU AI Act**

The legislation introduces **a risk-based classification** system that directly affects use cases such as **biometric identification**. We are proactively adapting our internal protocols to align with the **regulatory obligations**, including design-phase ethical considerations.

üë• **People first: Our team‚Äôs legal and ethical awareness**

AI is not only about data and models, but also about **human decision-making**. Our teams receive ongoing training in both **technical excellence** and **regulatory awareness**, including **legal and ethical comprehension** of AI development.

‚öñÔ∏è **From flexible to responsible AI**

Flexibility is a core asset of AI ‚Äî but without regulatory alignment, it may become a liability. We incorporate **ethics and legal constraints** as early as the **requirement-gathering phase** of each project.

---

### ‚úÖ Our mechanisms for responsible AI

We shared some concrete measures we‚Äôve implemented at Innovasur:

* **Dataset audits**: We examine **source**, **bias**, and **diversity** early on.
* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in development phase**: We detect **social biases** relevant to the specific **use case**.
* **Addressing the black-box nature of AI models**: We strive to integrate **interpretability** layers to make results **comprehensible** and **accountable**.

### Regulation as a driver of innovation

In the final part of my contribution, I reflected on the **conceptual map** that links **regulation, innovation, and technological advancement**:

* While regulation may initially appear as a barrier, it can **catalyze better practices**.
* The EU AI Act encourages companies to:
   * Validate their work within a normative framework.
   * Adopt **objective, traceable, and fair data practices**.
   * Create AI solutions that are **more robust and socially aligned**.

### Final thoughts

I closed my intervention by affirming that:

> "**The true potential of AI is only realized when we balance innovation with responsibility.**"

I fully support the EU‚Äôs initiative to regulate AI ‚Äî not as a restriction, but as a **guideline towards a safer and more human-centered future**.
